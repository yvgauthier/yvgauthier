# 👋 Hi, I’m Yvan Gauthier
I'm a software engineer interested in building software for the Apple ecosystem. I enjoy working with low-level languages such as C, C++, Objective-C, and Swift to produce useful software that people would enjoy using, whether to help or entertain them in their daily lives. I have a decade of experience working with UNIX systems like GNU/Linux, which I successfully used as my daily driver.

For the past few years, I've been running macOS, which is now my daily driver, and I love it. I've decided to focus my efforts on this platform. I'm always eager to learn and talk about tech-related subjects, discuss ideas, or hear feedback on what's working and what isn't. As long as it's constructive criticism, I'm perfectly fine with it. 😉

## 👀 I’m interested in ...
Building quality software, I love understanding the ins and outs of the software I write. I believe that, in most cases, understanding things at the deepest possible level allows us to make better decisions when solving specific problems. That’s why I love old-school languages like C and C++ so much—they allow developers to dive deep into what we do.

Of course, I’m not a C expert yet, and I’m still learning, but I love these languages for that reason alone. Objective-C is anothe language I’m going to investigate and experiment with, as it’s the main language used by Apple for their drivers.
